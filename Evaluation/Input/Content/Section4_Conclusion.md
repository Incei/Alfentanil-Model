The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of alfentanil after iv and oral administration of a variety of doses to healthy adults. Parameters that were optimized during parameter identification are in a close range to the measured or calculated values and, consistent with literature, no additional active processes were needed to describe the PK of alfentanil.

In conclusion, the presented alfentanil PBPK model is well-suited to be applied in drug-drug-interaction scenarios to predict the interaction potential.
